##CC learnings
1. Minimize the amount of essential complexity that anyone's brain has to deal with at any one time.
2. Keep accidental complexity from needlessly proliferating(increase rapidly).
3. High fan-out (more than about seven) indicates that a class uses a large number of other classes and may therefore be overly complex.
4. it's easier to restrict communication early and relax it later than it is to relax it early and then try to tighten it up after you've coded several hundred intersubsystem calls. 

## Levels of Design
1. Software System
2. Division into subsystem or packages.( Acyclic graph )
3. Division into classes
4. Division into routines
5. Internal Routine design

## WOW
1.the more easily other modules can call a module, the more loosely coupled it is
